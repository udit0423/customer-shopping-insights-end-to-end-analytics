# 🧠 Customer Behavior Analytics – End-to-End Data Intelligence Project

This project demonstrates a production-grade analytics workflow for understanding customer shopping behavior using Python, SQL, and Power BI. It simulates a real analytics environment where raw data is transformed into insights that guide business decisions across marketing, product, and operations.

## 🎯 Business Problem

A retail business wants to understand what drives customer purchases to improve revenue, retention, and targeted decision-making.

The project answers key business questions such as:

- Who are the most valuable customers?
- Which customer segments show high conversion potential?
- How do demographics influence buying behavior?
- Which product categories drive the highest revenue?
- What pricing ranges maximize conversion rates?
- Which regions have the strongest and weakest demand?
- Are there detectable patterns in customer frequency and spending?

This repository builds a complete analytics pipeline to solve these questions.
